                    <h3>Rule #1: Authors must have a track record of writing great content</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>I get a few dozen inquires each week for guest post contributions. Do you know why I don’t accept most of the posts? One reason is that I want Quick Sprout to remain my personal blog, which means I need to be the main writer. The second reason is that most of the authors don’t have a track record of writing awesome content.

                            Many of these guest authors have never written a guest post, which isn’t a big deal… but many of them don’t even have a great track record of writing awesome content on their own blog.

                            Here’s what I look for when authors offer me a guest post:

                            Spam – I Google their name to make sure they aren’t pushing out spammy content throughout the web.
                            Links – I make sure they aren’t linking out in their bio or within the content to spammy websites.
                            Depth – look to see how detailed their past content is. I usually look for authors who write content that is at least 1,000 words, if not 2,000. You can’t put much advice in a 400 word blog post, so avoid writers who are just trying to crank out content for links.
